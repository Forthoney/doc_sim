# Roadmap
Future plans for this project. Currently, the time limits are pretty arbitrary and subject to change depending on availability.

## Short Term
Goals before end of October 2023
- [ ] Implement CD
- [ ] Create Benchmark Suite
- [ ] Introduce trivial optimizations
- [ ] Expand Ruby interpreter support (Ruby 2.6+, TruffleRuby)

## Long Term
Goals before end of March 2024. These goals not only take long to implement, but might not be worth it at all, so will require consultation before committing to delivering.
- [ ] C extension: requires examination of interopability with TruffleRuby
